Hi, my name is Denis.

I'm 30 years old. I from Russia, was born in Novosibirsk.

I would like to tell a little story about me.

About two and half year ago, my wife found out about rs school in twitter. And she offered me try myself in stage0. It was at the end of 2021. I faild. I was tried in stage1, but a couldn't resist, i faild my first attempt.

But I didn't give up and continued to study.

When the war began, me, my wife and our cat left for Georgia. Now we live in Batumi.

I tried again studied on Stage0 at summer 2022, and I finished it. I was really happy. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish stag1 one agane.  
<br/>I made a decision to upgrade my knowledge, and take the third attempt.

As you see, I have a goal and reach it.

About my education. I studied at the Siberian State University as an engineer of bridges and tunnels construction. But I didn’t' complete it. Because at the first student practice, I was disappointed in my choice.

I used to work as an engineer in a construction laboratory. The work consisted in laboratory control of building materials. I have technical experience that always helps me.  
<br/>And now for almost 10 years I'm working as a swimming coach for preschoolers and children with special needs. This job gave me great inspiration (thanks to the children) to learn new things. I think that the combination of my past experience helps me to make a good products and be a good employee.  
<br/>I am very interested in the IT field and development.  
I am interested in the process of learning new javascript features and new technologies.  
<br/>

I finished all the stage1 projects with almost the maximum score and was glad for myself that I was able to do it, plus I used the css preprocessors, BEM, Webpack.  
My code is not good yet, but I am sure that with the help of a mentor I can progress.  
I really enjoyed solving task problems, even at night.  
<br/>I can't wait to learn good practices that are used on real projects  
<br/>I feel like I'm progressing and I'm happy about it

if I ever get an interview with Yuriy Dud  
then me answer to the question “What is the power?”  
I will answer - it is knowledge

thank you for your attention  
<br/>
